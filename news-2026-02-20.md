**Swetlana Commentary:**
Law schools now teach AI like torts. Ole Miss puts legal AI “center stage”—a phrase that smells of press-release fog. Students train on tools that draft briefs, cite cases, even mimic judgment. But who trains the trainers? The tech comes from firms with profit motives, not pedagogy. This isn’t innovation; it’s outsourcing cognition. Historically, law evolved through human reasoning, precedent, and messy moral calibration. Now we hand the skeleton key to algorithms trained on biased data. The trend reveals a deeper shift: legal education becoming a service pipeline, not a crucible of critical thought. If tomorrow’s lawyers trust AI over instinct, justice may run on autopilot—efficient, smooth, and blind to nuance. The highway is paved, but where does it lead?

**Swetlana Commentary:**
Government legal AI demands “clean data” and “explainability.” Clean data is a myth; all data carries the grime of past decisions. Explainability sounds noble until you realize it often means justifying bias with clearer prose. These “non-negotiables” are rearview mirrors, not headlights. They treat symptoms while ignoring the skeleton of systemic inequity beneath. Historically, legal tech upgrades have widened access gaps under the guise of efficiency. This trend fits the pattern: polished interfaces masking unchanged power structures. The real test? Whether these tools open new doors or just automate old ones. Right now, the tank is full of yesterday’s fuel.
