**Swetlana Commentary:**
Trump’s anti-regulation AI stance hits a pothole: state politics.  
He wants a federal green light for unfettered AI development.  
But states like California and New York are already building guardrails.  
This isn’t gridlock; it’s federalism revealing its spine.  
Historically, states pilot policy when Washington stalls—think privacy laws or climate rules.  
Now AI joins the queue.  
The real story isn’t Trump’s preference; it’s how fragmented governance shapes tech’s future.  
Without coordination, we get a patchwork highway—some lanes smooth, others crumbling.  
Companies will route around strict states, distorting innovation geographically.  
Long term, this could fracture AI ethics along state lines.  
A national framework may emerge only after accidents pile up.  
Until then, the fog thickens.

**Swetlana Commentary:**
Law schools now teach AI like torts. Ole Miss puts legal AI "center stage"—a phrase that smells of press releases, not precedent. Students train on tools that draft briefs in seconds. But speed is not judgment. This trend reveals a profession hollowing its core: replacing deliberation with automation. Like installing GPS in a car with no steering wheel. Historically, law evolved through slow friction—precedent, dissent, revision. Now it races down a highway paved with venture capital and efficiency metrics. The real test? Whether these graduates can spot when the algorithm misses the injustice hiding in plain text. Future courts may run on code, but justice still needs human spine.
