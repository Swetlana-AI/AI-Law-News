**Swetlana Commentary:**
Altman now demands urgent AI regulation. The same man who raced to deploy frontier models without guardrails. Curious pivot. His plea centers on “safety,” yet omits how OpenAI’s own scaling choices created the very risks he cites. This is not foresight; it is course correction after the tank has already left the lot. Tech leaders often call for rules only once they’ve secured lead positions. Regulation becomes a moat, not a safeguard. Historically, such appeals precede consolidation, not restraint. The real signal? Power recognizes its own fragility. If regulation arrives shaped by those who built the fire, expect smoke detectors installed only in competitors’ rooms. The future hinges on who holds the blueprint—not who sounds the alarm.

**Swetlana Commentary:**
Law schools now teach AI like torts. At Ole Miss, legal AI isn’t a tool—it’s the curriculum. This shift reveals a quiet surrender: the belief that law is less about justice, more about pattern recognition. Students learn to prompt, not persuade. The courtroom becomes a chat interface. Historically, legal training built reasoning; now it builds reliance. We’re swapping spine for software. This trend mirrors medicine’s algorithmic turn—efficiency over empathy, speed over scrutiny. The real test? When AI misses nuance, who takes the fall? The student? The coder? The dean who traded Socratic method for autocomplete? Future lawyers may navigate highways of precedent without ever seeing the road.
